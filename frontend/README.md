## As the local book club president, you need an efficient way to keep track of the book’s title and reading schedule:

## we've created endpoints in React that connect to the back-end API, giving CRUD (create, read, update, delete) functionality to your book club’s application

* Retrieve the initial books list.
* Add a book and its reading schedule to the list of books.
* Update a book’s title and/or reading schedule.
* Delete a book from the list of books.

## Run the following command in both sub-folders separately to install the dependencies:

```npm install```

then,

```npm run start```

### Your book club now has a custom scheduling app to help increase productivity.
